# API v2.0 - Complete Redesign

## What's new

We've launched API v2.0 with a completely redesigned architecture that's faster, more intuitive, and packed with new capabilities. GraphQL support, real-time subscriptions, and comprehensive SDK updates.

## Impact

Developers get 10x faster response times, improved error handling, and powerful new features like bulk operations and real-time updates. The new SDK reduces integration time from days to hours.

## Changes

### ‚ú® Features

- **GraphQL API**: Full GraphQL endpoint with schema introspection and playground
- **Real-time subscriptions**: WebSocket-based live updates for changelog changes
- **Bulk operations**: Process up to 1000 changelogs in a single API call
- **Advanced pagination**: Cursor-based pagination with configurable page sizes
- **Comprehensive filtering**: Query by date ranges, version types, and custom metadata
- **Rate limiting transparency**: Clear headers showing remaining quota and reset times

### üöÄ Improvements

- **10x faster responses**: Optimized database queries and intelligent caching
- **Better error messages**: Structured error responses with clear resolution steps  
- **Automatic retries**: Built-in exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Request/response compression**: Reduced bandwidth usage by up to 70%

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- Authentication now requires API key in header instead of query parameter
- Date formats standardized to ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ)
- Pagination parameters renamed: `page` ‚Üí `cursor`, `limit` ‚Üí `first`
- Error response structure changed to include `code`, `message`, and `details`

## Upgrade

API v1 remains supported until December 2025. Migration guide and automated tools available. New projects should use v2 immediately.

**Migration steps:**
1. Update authentication headers in your requests
2. Update date parsing to handle ISO 8601 format  
3. Update pagination logic to use cursor-based approach
4. Update error handling for new response structure

## Related changes

This release includes new SDKs for Python, Go, and Rust. Documentation has been completely rewritten with interactive examples.
