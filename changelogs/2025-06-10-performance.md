# Major Performance Optimizations

## What's new

Significant performance improvements across the platform with 40% faster page loads, optimized database queries, and enhanced caching strategies.

## Impact

Users experience dramatically faster load times, especially on slower connections. Large changelog collections now load instantly with our new pagination system.

## Changes

### üöÄ Improvements

- **40% faster page loads**: Optimized bundle sizes and lazy loading implementation
- **Database query optimization**: Reduced average query time from 200ms to 50ms
- **Enhanced caching**: Intelligent caching with 95% cache hit rate for repeated requests
- **Image optimization**: WebP format with fallbacks, reducing image sizes by 60%
- **Bundle splitting**: Smart code splitting reduces initial bundle size by 35%
- **CDN improvements**: Global CDN deployment for static assets with edge caching

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed memory leak in changelog list rendering for large datasets
- Resolved slow scroll performance when viewing changelogs with many images
- Fixed timeout issues when loading changelog collections over 1000 items
- Improved error handling for network timeouts and retries

### üîß Technical Improvements

- Migrated to React 18 with concurrent features for better perceived performance
